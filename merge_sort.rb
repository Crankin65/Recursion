=begin
  Assignment 
  Build a method #merge_sort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
Tips:
Think about what the base case is and what behavior is happening again and again and can actually be delegated to someone else (e.g. that same method!).
It may be helpful to check out the background videos again if you donâ€™t quite understand what should be going on.

    half = array.size / 2

    right = merge_sort(array[half...array.size])
    merge(left,right)

def merge(left, right, array = [])
  (left.size + right.size).times do

  # Take array
  # split in half
  # if array.size > 2, split in half 
    # elsif look at left most element
    # compare to right element 
    # sort, look at right element 
    # return to case above, sort right
    # sort right
    # return to top, sort right

  # base case = array.size < 2 && been sorted
